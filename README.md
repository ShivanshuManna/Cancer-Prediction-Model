# 🧬 Cancer Risk Assessment Web Application

A Machine Learning based web application built using **Flask** that predicts cancer stage based on selected health and lifestyle factors.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses a trained machine learning model to analyze user inputs and predict the cancer stage.

The application provides a clean medical-style interface and displays results in a professional popup dialog.

---

## 📊 Input Parameters

The model takes the following inputs:

- Genetic Risk (0 – 10)
- Air Pollution Level (0 – 10)
- Alcohol Use (0 – 10)
- Smoking Level (0 – 10)
- Obesity Level (0 – 10)

The model predicts:

- Stage 0
- Stage 1
- Stage 2
- Stage 3
- Stage 4

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Pickle

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters health-related values.
2. Data is sent to the Flask backend.
3. The trained model predicts a numeric stage.
4. A mapping function converts numeric output into:
   - Stage 0
   - Stage 1
   - Stage 2
   - Stage 3
   - Stage 4
5. The result is displayed in a modal popup.
